Project 1 - Creating a game

BLACKJACK
-you play against the dealer and see who can get closer to 21 without going over
- you and the dealer will both be dealt two cards, both of yours are face up, the dealer has one hidden.
- you will then have the option to hit(get another card) or stand(stay with your current cards)
- after you have made your decision, the dealer will reveal his hidden card, if his sum is lower than 17 he has no choice but to draw another card, if his sum is 17 or higher he has to stay.
- if the dealer goes over 21 and you are at 21 or lower, you win
- if you go over 21(bust), you automatically lose, or if your sum is lower than the dealers sum, you lose

USER STORIES
- as the user I want to beat the dealer hand that is dealt.
- I will use logic along with basic addition to chose wether I hit or stand based on what the dealer is showing
