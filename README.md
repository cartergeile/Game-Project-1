# BLACKJACK
- Play against the dealer and see who can get closer to 21 without going over.
- The player and the dealer will both be dealt two cards, both of yours are face up, the dealer has one hidden.
- The player will then have the option to hit(get another card) or stand(stay with your current cards).
- After the player has made their decision, the dealer will reveal their hidden card; if dealer's sum is lower than 17 they have no choice but to draw another card, if dealer's sum is 17 or higher they have to stay.
- If the dealer goes over 21 and the player is at 21 or lower, the player wins.
- If the player goes over 21(bust), the player automatically loses; or if player's sum is lower than the dealers sum, you lose.
